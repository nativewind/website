<Callout type="warn">
**Important:** Nativewind v5 is not yet available. This guide is to prepare people for the upgrade process.
</Callout>

Welcome to the official upgrade guide for **Nativewind v5**. This release introduces several foundational changes that align Nativewind with the future of React Native while maintaining backward compatibility with the core API.

> **Note:** Nativewind v5 includes breaking changes in its underlying dependencies and internal architecture. Please review all sections carefully before upgrading.

## Breaking Changes & Prerequisites

Before upgrading to Nativewind v5, your project **must** meet the following version requirements:

### Tailwind CSS v4.1+

Nativewind v5 is built on top of Tailwind CSS v4.1+. You must upgrade your Tailwind configuration and tooling accordingly.

<Callout type="tip">
**Migration Tip:** Refer to the [Tailwind CSS v4 Upgrade Guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/upgrade-guide) for detailed steps.
</Callout>

### React Native 0.79+

React Native 0.79 introduces architectural changes that Nativewind v5 relies on, including improvements to the StyleSheet and layout engines.

> Use `react-native upgrade` or migrate your setup manually to update.

### React Native Reanimated v4+

Nativewind v5 uses internal features that depend on Reanimated v4+. Ensure your project uses this version to avoid runtime crashes or build issues.

> **Note:** Reanimated v4 introduces its own breaking changes — consult the [Reanimated v4 changelog](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/) when upgrading.

### React Native CSS

Nativewind previously used a transient dependency on a library called `react-native-css-interop`. This library has been renamed to `react-native-css` and moved to a `peerDependency` and will require installation.

Nativewind will no longer be tied to a specific version of `react-native-css` and the two libraries can be updated individually.

## No Runtime Breaking Changes — But Some Deprecations

Nativewind v5 preserves its existing API. Your usage of:

- `className`
- `styled`

...will continue to work without modification.

However, several features are being **deprecated** and will emit runtime warnings during development. These features will be **removed in a future major release**.

<Callout type="warn">
**Warning:** Deprecated features will continue to function in v5 but should be migrated away from as soon as possible.
</Callout>

However, there will be a number of breaking changes to how Nativewind functions and its configuration file that may affect you.

## JSX Transform → Replaced by Import Rewrites

Nativewind v5 **removes the JSX transform** that previously injected Tailwind support into individual JSX elements. This has been replaced by a new **import rewrite system**.

This does not require any configuration change, but may affect your app if you are performing your own import rewrites. Previously Nativewind would change this code:

```jsx
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';

<View className="bg-red-500 p-4">
  <Text className="text-white">Hello</Text>
</View>
```

Now the `import` will be rewritten to `import { View, Text } from 'react-native-css/react-native'`

The move to import rewrites is driven by a broader shift in the React Native ecosystem of publishing compiled libraries. Nativewind previously took advantage that libraries were always compiled locally which allowed us to override the `jsxImportSource`. When libraries are compiled externally, their JSX is already transformed. The new shift to import rewrites is similar to how existing libraries such as `react-native-web` work.

## `cssInterop` / `remapProps` → Replaced by `styled()`

The `cssInterop` and `remapProps` APIs are deprecated and replaced with a unified `styled` API. It accepts the same options as `cssInterop`/`remapProps` and returns the same component. The `remapProps` mode is available via a new 3rd parameter:

```jsx
// Same as cssInterop()
styled(View, { className: 'style'})

// Same as remapProps()
styled(View, { className: 'style'}, { passThrough: true })
```

By default `styled()` enables the transform globally for that component, but this can be disabled by setting `global` to false:

```jsx
const MyComponent = styled(View, { className: 'style'}, { global: false })
```

## `shadow-*` → `box-shadow`

Previously the `shadow-*` utilities mapped to the React Native [shadow props](https://reactnative.dev/docs/shadow-props). They will now map to a [box shadow style](https://reactnative.dev/docs/boxshadowvalue).

## `nativewind/theme` → Replaced by custom CSS

If you are using the new Tailwind CSS v4 CSS config file, you are unable to import the `nativewind/theme` functions. These have been replaced with custom CSS.

### `platformColor`

`platformColor()` is available as a CSS function:

```css
@theme {
  --color-error: platformColor(systemRed, red)
}
```

### `hairlineWidth`

`hairlineWidth()` is available as a CSS function:

```css
@theme {
  --spacing-hairline: hairlineWidth()
}
```

### `pixelRatio`

`pixelRatio()` is available as a CSS function:

```css
@theme {
  --spacing-doublePixelRatio: calc(pixelRatio(2) * 2)
}
```

### `fontScale`

`fontScale()` is available as a CSS function:

```css
@theme {
  --spacing-doubleFontScale: calc(fontScale(2) * 2)
}
```

### `getPixelSizeForLayoutSize`

`getPixelSizeForLayoutSize()` is available as a CSS function:

```css
@theme {
  --spacing-custom: getPixelSizeForLayoutSize(42)
}
```

### `roundToNearestPixel`

`roundToNearestPixel()` is available as a CSS function:

```css
@theme {
  --spacing-custom: roundToNearestPixel(calc(10 / 3))
}
```

### `platformSelect`

Now use a media query that sets the platform as the media type:

```css
@theme {
  --color-error: var(--my-color, green)
}

@media ios {
  :root {
    --my-color: red;
  }
}

@media android {
  :root {
    --my-color: blue;
  }
}
```

### `pixelRatioSelect` / `fontScaleSelect`

Now use a media query:

```css
@theme {
  --spacing-custom-pixel: 11;
  --spacing-custom-font: 11;
}

@media (pixelRatio() > 2) {
  :root {
    --spacing-custom-pixel: 3;
  }
}

@media (fontScale() > 2) {
  :root {
    --spacing-custom-font: 3;
  }
}
```
